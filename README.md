# incursion
In order to make the Incursions more secure for the participants, the Incursion Department has introduced the SRP (Ship's Compensation Program). This means that if your ship falls for any reason during the incursion, you will receive the full JitaSell price for that fit.
In order to implement this system, we will be collecting a premium from those who have joined the fleet upon leaving the fleet, according to the following conditions

1) N-JD
2) Inca club beginners (less than 5 days of participation in Inca club)
0.5M per site for those who meet the above conditions (1) and (2).

(3) Those who do not meet the above conditions (1) and (2) will receive 1M per site.

These figures are based on the case where the number of people receiving the clear reward is 10 (20 in the case of AS), and for each additional person, the amount will be reduced by 0.05M for those who fall under (1) and (2), and by 0.1M for those who fall under (3).


The calculation formula is as follows.
The number of people who receive the reward will be checked from the journal.

Number of site attacks × (Basic amount - Reduction × Excess number of people)



Premium calculation example A)
Number of recipients: 13 Number of sites attacked: 11
(1) (2) 11(0.5 - 0.05 x 3) = 3.85M
(3) 11(1 - 0.1 x 3) = 7.7M

Example of premium calculation B)
Number of recipients: 14 Number of sites attacked: 9　
Number of recipients: 12 Number of sites attacked: 3
①② 9(0.5 - 0.05 × 4) + 3(0.5 - 0.05 × 2) = 3.9M
(3) 9(1 - 0.1 × 4) + 3(1 - 0.1 × 2) = 7.8M

Premium Calculation Example C)
Number of recipients: 10 Number of sites attacked: 11
①② 11 × 0.5 = 5.5M
(3) 11 × 1 = 11M


This system is a kind of mutual aid insurance.
If you noticeably forget to send money, we will judge that you have no intention to send money and you will not receive SRP, except for exceptions.
Exceptions.
If FC/logistics error is a factor, half of Fit's JitaSell price will be paid.
